# Microsoft Defender 365 Advanced Hunting queries

This repository contains a series of Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries for use in Microsoft 365 Defender's Advanced Hunting function. These queries can be used to perform proactive threat hunts for common Cyber Security issues. Some require some customisation before use, there are comments next to variables that require customisation detailing what steps to take. 

While these searches were designed for 365 Defender Advanced Hunting, as these are written in KQL they should act as a good starting point for creating custom queries in Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection and Microsoft Sentinel Log Analytics.

For more information on using Defender 365 Advanced Hunting and performing custom queries, see [this overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender/advanced-hunting-overview?view=o365-worldwide) on the Microsoft website.
